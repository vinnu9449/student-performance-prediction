# 📚 Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts final student grades (**G3**) using the **UCI Student Performance Dataset**.  
It uses features like first and second period grades (**G1**, **G2**), study time, absences, and past failures.

✅ **Built with:**  
- Python (Google Colab)
- pandas
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

## 📂 Dataset
[UCI Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab**.  
2. Upload the dataset file (`student-mat.csv`).  
3. Run the cells step by step.  

## 📈 Project Highlights
- Data cleaning & exploration.
- Trained a Linear Regression model to predict final grades.
- Visualized actual vs. predicted results.
